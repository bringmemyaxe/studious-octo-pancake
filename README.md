Steps:

1. Install librosa module for Python 3.x if you don't have it

`pip3 install librosa`

2. Put your *.wav sounds replacing them with names `ref_sound1.wav` / `ref_sound2.wav` / `ref_sound3.wav` / `ref_sound4.wav` in the folder `ref_sounds`

3. Install Python 2.x to make CollectSamples.py work.

`sudo apt install python`
